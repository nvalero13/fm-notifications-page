## About

I've done this Front-end Mentor exercise using React to create this component structure with conditional rendering typical of notifications.

I also used CSS Modules to test the syntax and get familiar with it.

I've tried to make the exercise as scalable as possible, treating the information as it could come from an API and trying to parameterize as much as possible the component.

The measures are a bit by eye because I have not used the premium function with the figma design and I had to rely on a png.
